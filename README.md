# CTAGDRC (CTAG Dynamic Range Compressor)


The selected JUCE plugin is "CTAGDRC" (i.e. CTAG Dynamic Range Compressor), by p-hlp (https://github.com/p-hlp/CTAGDRC). The attached report focuses on an overview of the general characteristics of the compressor and then switches to the analysis of a particular feature, namely its "Look-ahead" mode, which implements an interesting way of handling possible complications that may occur while using the plugin.
